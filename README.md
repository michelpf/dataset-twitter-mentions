# Twitter Mentiones

This dataset was originally downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/julienjta/twitter-mentions-volumes).

The goal of this repository is to facilitate the teaching of Python classes with organized data.

A collection of Twitter mentions of large publicly-traded companies:

* Apple
* Amazon
* Salesforce
* CVS
* Facebook
* Google
* IBM
* Coca-Cola
* Pfizer

The metric value represents the number of mentions for a given ticker symbol every 5 minutes.

This dataset was adapted for use in Machine Learning classes.
